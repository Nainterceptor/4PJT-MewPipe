Ergonomics and ease of use
==========================

## Design

* We chose a dark theme design for clarity. It is a much better experience when watching a video to have a black background. 
The primary color is a deep grey along with some white. Some information and titles are colored in a smooth dark blue. 

* The design is flat, simple and created to make the navigation intuitive and easy to use.

## UX

* The site has been designed to be clear. There is many picture and helpful words for a basic user. 
With this, we think it's really easy to upload, watch and share video you like.

* To prevent account accumulation, we have implement a Twitter account connexion. 
Making the possibility to use your Twitter account to login to MewPipe.
Some others OpenID implementations are easy to implement, like Spotify, Github, Facebook, GPlus and so one...
